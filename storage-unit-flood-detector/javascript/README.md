# Storage Unit Flood Detector in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This storage unit flood detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Intel® Arduino/Genuino 101 board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or from the Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft\* Azure\*, IoT from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a storage unit flood detector that:<br>
- continuously checks the moisture sensor.<br>
- sounds an audible warning in case of a possible flooding.<br>
- stores a record of each time water is detected, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This storage unit flood detector uses the moisture sensor to constantly ensure that your stored belongings are not destroyed by water damage.

If the moisture level exceeds a defined threshold, it makes a sound to indicate a warning.

Optionally, the monitor can store moisture data using the Intel IoT Examples Datastore or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS account.

### Installing the program manually on the Intel® Edison board

Alternatively, you can set up the code manually on the Intel® Edison board.

Clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository to your Intel® Edison board after you establish an SSH connection to it, as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Then, navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git\* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet), establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/js/flood-detect.jpg)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

### Manual Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js\* modules needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison board, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284

You must install the Intel® XDK on the Intel® IoT Gateway, by following the directions on the above link, under the section "Connecting to the Intel® XDK".

The Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manully on to your Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

You will also need to configure the `config.json` in the example to use the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101. See the section "Configuring the example" below.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

The DFRobot\* variation of this example does not yet support the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101.

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/flood-detect",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt/)

## Running the program using Intel® XDK IoT Edition

When you're ready to run the example, make sure you have saved all the files.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-upload.png)

Click the **Upload** icon to upload the files to the Intel® Edison board.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-run.png)

Click the **Run** icon at the bottom of Intel® XDK IoT Edition. This runs the code on the Intel® Edison board.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-upload-run.png)

If you made changes to the code, click **Upload and Run**. This runs the latest code with your changes on the Intel® Edison board.

![](./../../images/js/flood-detect-output.png)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on the Intel® Edison board, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Determining the Intel® Edison board's IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.

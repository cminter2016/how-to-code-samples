# Plant Lighting System in C++

## Introduction

This automatic plant lighting system monitor application is part of a series of how-tos for Intel's Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to set the lighting time and store this data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Invoke the services of the Twilio\* API for sending text messages.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using Microsoft Azure\* IoT Hub, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create an automatic plant lighting monitor system that:

- checks if a separate automated lighting system is turned on or off based on a configurable schedule, by using a light sensor.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone to set the lighting periods via a built-in web interface.
- monitors water levels using a connected moisture sensor.
- logs events from the lighting system, using cloud-based data storage.
- sends text messages to alert the user if the system is not working as expected.

## How it works

This lighting system has a few useful features.

You can set the lighting system schedule via a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, using your mobile phone.

If the lighting is supposed to be on but the light sensor does not detect light, the application sends an SMS alert to a specified number through Twilio\*.

It also automatically checks the moisture sensor data at specified intervals and logs that information.

Optionally, all data can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS account\*.

### Twilio\* API Key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* web site:

[https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

You can still run the example, but without a Twilio API key you cannot send SMS alerts.

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284

The Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), a Machine To Machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.
![](./../../images/cpp/add-name-and-var.png)
5. Your new name symbol and value will now be displayed. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/name-var-ok.png)
6. Another dialog box will appear asking to rebuild project. Click **OK**.

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System Studio

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/watering-system; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/watering-system"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"; export TWILIO_SID="Enter Twilio SID Here"; export TWILIO_TOKEN="Enter Twilio Token Here"; export TWILIO_TO="Enter Number to Send to here Formattted 555-555-5555"; export TWILIO_FROM="Enter Number to be Sent From Here Formated 555-555-5555"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Intel® System Studio.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

Successful output should be similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-equp-act-mon-successful-output.png)

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
For help using the shell script, go to this link:

[how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](./../../docs/cpp/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)

### Setting the lighting schedule

The schedule for the lighting system is set using a single-page web interface served up from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/plant-ligt-app.png)

The latest data values from the connected Grove\* Moisture Sensor are displayed at the bottom of the web page.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway is connected to Wi-Fi\* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
